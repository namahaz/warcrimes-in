Israel Defence Forces conducted an airstrike that hit part of the Church of Saint Porphyrius where 500 Muslims and Christians had been sheltering from bombardments. At least 18 Palestinians were killed in the airstrike with exterior damage to the third oldest church in the world. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned it as a "a war crime that cannot be ignored."
