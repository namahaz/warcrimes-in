On 31 October, Reproters Sans Frontiers said that 34 journalists have been killed in the conflict, including 12 "in connection with their work", 10 of which were killed in Israel's attack on Gaza; they described the first two weeks of the conflict as the deadliest start of a war in the 21st century for journalists. In some cases families of journalists have also been killed. Notably, on 25 October, the wife, son and daughter of Al Jazeera journalist Wael Al-Dahdouh were killed by an Israeli airstrike of the house where they were residing in the Nuseirat camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip.
