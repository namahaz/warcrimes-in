Since October 22nd, 2023, Israel Defense Forces conducted airstrikes on United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) school in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp. UNRWA confirmed that 29 of their staff had been killed since 7 October, half of whom were teachers. The UNRWA Commissioner General responded saying, "This is outrageous, and it again shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians."
