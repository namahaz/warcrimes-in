On 13 October, the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of 1.1 million people from north Gaza forcing a Norweigan diploat to conclude, "There are hundreds of thousands of people fleeing for their lifeâ€¦It is a forcible transfer of people from all of northern Gaza, which according to the Geneva convention is a war crime." On 13 October 2023, a draft document prepared by Israel's Ministry of Intelligence proposed moving 2.3 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated there should be "no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza."
