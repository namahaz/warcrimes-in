The legislative work of our elected Democrats by offering unchecked support for Israel, is shaping Israel's violent occupation and siege of Palestine. I want to make clear that I condemn the actions of Hamas on October 7th and support an immediate release of all the hostages. 

However, the actions of the Israeli government, with support from it's allies and state departments reveals a troubling intent: the oppression and dehumanizing of Palestinian people through the 75 year occupation, their collective punishment through a siege, and their displacement and mass deaths through indiscriminate bombings. Over 1.4 millions Gazans are now displaced, over 5,000 Gazans are considered missing under rubble, over 10,000 Gazans are considered dead, half of them children, all while Israeli officials maintain calls to further the humanitarian crisis and our elected officials show unconditional support for such "consequences of war."

This has escalated well beyond condemnations or gestures of minimizing casualties. Such unspeakable crimes against humanity are a consequential issue in my support of the Democratic Party. I implore you to stand against Israel's brutality against a civilian population and stand on the right side of history. My conscience cannot abet candidates who support war crimes or stand by idly.
