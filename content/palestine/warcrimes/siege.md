Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had ordered “a complete siege of the Gaza Strip,” home to 2.2 million Palestinians, nearly half of them children. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” he said. “We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.” Israel's president Isaac Herzog accused the residents of Gaza of collective responsibility for the war. Oxfam stated Israel's use of "starvation as a method of war" was a violation of international law, and that Gaza was being "collectively punished in full view of the world."
