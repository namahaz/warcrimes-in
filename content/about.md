# "We want to judge the killers of children."

#### Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7th, Israeli Defence Forces have been directed to kill 10,203 Gazan civilians including 4,812 children with 2,551 Gazans considered missing under rubble. 53,700 units have been destroyed leaving over 1,600,000 Gazans displaced. These are widely considered war crimes. With the goal of calling for a ceasefire, disarmament and war crime trials, organizers are hanging up these posters around the world.

â€”

### Why

#### On November 8th, 20 Gazan children held a press conference outside the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City asking the world to protect them. This project answers their pleas to hold accountable the killers of children.

â€”

### But

#### Hamas. The actions of militant Palestinian groups also amount to war crimes but as Israel is not a party to the treaty, and the International Criminal Court has yet to make a determination on jurisdiction. The ICC can hold Israel and possibly the USA, accountable for war crimes in Palestine, which is a member state.
