## "We want to judge the killers of children."

### Why

On November 8th, 20 Gazan children held a press conference outside the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City asking the world to protect them. This project answers their pleas to hold accountable the killers of children.

### But
Hamas. The actions of militant Palestinian groups also amount to war crimes but as Israel is not a party to the treaty, the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction in Israel. The ICC can only hold Israel and possibly the USA, accountable for war crimes in Palestine, which is a member state.
